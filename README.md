# Spaces between my fingers
A pictorial blogging built with Meteor. I have been self teaching Meteor, and this is what I have learned so far. Feel free to contribute or fork.

# Technology
Meteor
Iron Router

# To Do
Implement Draft
Implement Edit Post
Implement Pagination or auto load more post feature
Implement page redirection upon successful actions
Implement one click upload image and submit post (Upload img first then, submit the post)
Update the gallery page for better visual
Implement date picker
refactor for page routing (The implementation is quite hacky.)
